Show the Local Weather
======================
An Elm-based solution to Free Code Camp's [Show the Local
Weather](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather) front
end development project.

Objective
---------
Build an app that is functionally similar to this:
<http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV>.

User stories
------------
1.  I can see the weather in my current location.

2.  I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot
    desert) depending on the weather.

3.  I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The live demo can be found at
<https://huggablemonad.github.io/fcc-local-weather/>.

This project uses a modified version of Bootstrap's
[Cover](https://getbootstrap.com/examples/cover/) example.
